HISTORY
-------

I wrote this early in 2001 so I could manage my personal library.
That was BEFORE I went to library school.  There were a couple of
programs out there for managing personal libraries, but none suited my
needs, so I wrote this.  I had never taken a cataloguing course, knew
nothing about MARC records, and wasn't a very good programmer.  (The
first two changed, the third is still true.)  

If I were doing this again I'd do it very differently, or I might not
do it at all.  I might use LibraryThing to manage my collection.  If I
wrote something for myself I'd use Python or Ruby with a good web
framework.  But I did this in 2001, before any of that, and I've used
it ever since, and it does its job: I know what I have and where it
is.

I don't expect any interest in this, but I'm putting it on GitHub to
make my life easier, and because there's no reason to keep it private.
